# Object Oriented Programming with Java

## Concepts Used

### 1. Packages in Java.
  - Built packages `com.EMS._abstract`, `com.EMS.core` and `com.EMS.iomanager` to manage the project conviniently.
### 2. Interfaces (Abstraction in Java).
  - Built `BaseEmployee`, `BaseOrganization` and `IOManager` interfaces in package `com.EMS._abstract` to create an abstraction.
### 3. Getters and Setters.
  - Built getters and setters for all the attributes in all the classes in all packages.
### 4. File Management.
  - Use several classes present in package ``java.io`` for proper file management.
### 5. Serialization.
  - Built serializable classes to save raw java objects as ``.ser`` files and retrive them later to work with.
### 6. Multiple Inheitance.
  - Perform multiple inheritance in several classes to demonstrate and test the behaviour of different classes and their objects.
### 7. Constructor and Parameterized Constructor.
  - Create constructor and parameterized constructor for all classes to initialize the attributes appropriately.
### 8. String and StringBuffer Methods
  - Use multiple `String` and `StringBuffer` methods for managing the output on console and in files.
### 9. Exceptions.
  - Used `try` `catch` blocks to print proper exception message. Use `throw` and `throws` keywords to throw proper exceptions.
### 10. Methods and Static Methods.
  - Everything is done using methods and at times static methods are also used.
### 11. A list of keywords used:
  - `this` for accessing class variables.
  - `final` to declare constant variables.
  - `static` to create a static block of code.
  - `try`, `catch`, `throw` and `throws` for exception management.
  - `interface` to create a interface.
  - `public` and `private` access modifiers to declare methods, classes and variables.
  - Many other common and trivial keywords.
